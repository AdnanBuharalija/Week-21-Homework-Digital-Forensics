King,

 Long time no see...I have a juicy proposition for you. Two weeks from now, me and my associates are planning a heist at the national gallery. Although, we need a helping hand. I know that you are on parole right now and are probably hesitant to participate. Me and your parole officer go years back. He is a very strict fellow. If he were to find out that you
were dealing drugs and shooting dope in your veins every night, i feel he wouldn't be too happy. It's very easy for a person to phone the feds an anonymous tip that you are on drugs and the location of your stash. All they have to do is give you a drug test and since you're on parole, the feds don't need a search warrant. Well hit me up. You know where to find
me.
